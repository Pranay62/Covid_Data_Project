**SQL Project for "COVID 19 DATA EXPLORATION"**

This SQL project aims to explore COVID-19 data using various queries. 
The project uses two tables, namely CovidDeaths$ and CovidVaccinations$, to retrieve the necessary data.

This SQL project explores COVID-19 data, focusing on deaths and vaccinations, and aims to provide insights into the impact of the pandemic globally.
The queries in this project include selecting data for exploration, analyzing the total cases and deaths, comparing total cases to population, 
identifying the countries with the highest infection rates and death counts per population, breaking down the data by continent, 
and looking at global numbers.

The project also includes creating a view to store data for later visualization. The final output of the project is a dataset that shows the 
percentage of people vaccinated in different countries and continents.

This project is useful for anyone interested in understanding the impact of COVID-19 on a global scale and how vaccination 
campaigns are progressing in different parts of the world.
