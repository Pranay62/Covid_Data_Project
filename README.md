## SQL Project for "COVID 19 DATA EXPLORATION"

This SQL project aims to explore COVID-19 data using various queries. The project uses two tables, namely CovidDeaths$ and CovidVaccinations$, to retrieve the necessary data.

## Dataset Details

The project utilizes two datasets:

- CovidDeaths$: Contains information about COVID-19 deaths, including country, date, and death counts.
- CovidVaccinations$: Contains information about COVID-19 vaccinations, including country, date, and vaccination counts.

## Project Goals

The main goals of this project are:

1. **Data Exploration**: Use SQL queries to explore and analyze COVID-19 data related to deaths and vaccinations.
2. **Insights Generation**: Extract meaningful insights from the data to understand the impact of the pandemic globally and the progress of vaccination campaigns.
3. **Visualization**: Store the processed data in a view for later visualization and analysis.

## SQL Queries

The SQL queries used in this project cover various aspects of COVID-19 data analysis, including:

- Selecting data for exploration
- Analyzing total cases and deaths
- Comparing total cases to population
- Identifying countries with the highest infection rates and death counts per population
- Breaking down the data by continent
- Analyzing global numbers

## Usage

To replicate the analysis and explore the COVID-19 data using SQL:

1. Ensure that you have a compatible database management system (DBMS) installed (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server).
2. Create a database and import the provided CovidDeaths$ and CovidVaccinations$ tables.
3. Copy the SQL code from the SQLCode.sql file and execute it in your DBMS to run the queries.
4. Analyze the results and extract insights from the COVID-19 data.
